# Events Mapping

Developed a dynamic, interactive map application using Mapbox GL JS, integrating real-time geolocation tracking with the Geolocation API and Mapbox Directions API for turn-by-turn navigation. The application dynamically adds markers based on geospatial data, with custom popups displaying detailed information about the events such as name and local rankings etc.

Leveraged JavaScript for map behavior, geolocation handling, and marker management, while using HTML and CSS for a responsive, user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates expertise in web mapping, geospatial data visualization, and front-end development with third-party API integration.
